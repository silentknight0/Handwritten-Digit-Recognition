# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Implemented 3 handwritten digit recognition systems using Tensorflow:
1. Using a feed-forward Neural Network with dropout and learning rate decay. Testing Accuracy:96.04%
2. Using a Convolution Neural Network with dropout. Testing Accuracy:97%
3. Using a Recurrent Neural Network,Long-short-term-memory-cell. Testing Accuracy:98.7%

Dataset: MNIST

All the models are trained with Adam Optimizer with Mini-batch gradient descent on softmax cross entropy loss.
